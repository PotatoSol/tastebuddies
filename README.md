This program is a work in progress.  A more complete README will be submitted when it is complete.  

This program is intended to take in a user's multiple social media accounts, and music libraries, and create recommendations for them based on their followings
on other social medias.  For example, if a user is following Justin Bieber on Twitter, it will recommend Justin Bieber's Instagram account, and his songs
on Spotify.
